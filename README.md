# Algorithms and data structures implemented in C++17

Here I will place some efficient algorithms and data structures implemented from scratch in C++17. They are implemented in header files using templating.

## Testing

Tests are implemented using [googletest library](https://github.com/google/googletest). To run tests install gtest first.

## Already available

### Algorithms

- Radix sort

### Structures

- Segment tree
- Fenwick tree

## Detailed description

For detailed description see corresponding md files in _algo_ and _struct_ folders.
