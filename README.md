# Algorithms and data structures implemented in C++17

Here I will place some efficient algorithms and data structures implemented from scratch in C++17. They are implemented in header files using templating.

## Testing

Tests are implemented using [googletest library](https://github.com/google/googletest). To run tests install gtest first.

## Already available

### Algorithms

- Sorting
   - Radix sort
   - Cartesian sort
- Strings
   - Suffix array with induced sortig
   - String search

### Structures

- Segment tree
- Fenwick tree
- Red-black tree family:
   - Set/Multiset
   - Map/Multimap
   - Set/Multiset with dynamic ordering capabilities
   - Map with dynamic ordering capabilities
- Big integer
