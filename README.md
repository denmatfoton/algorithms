# Algorithms and data structures implemented in C++17

Here I will place some efficient algorithms and data structures implemented from scratch in C++17. They are implemented in header files using templating.

## Testing

Tests are implemented using [googletest library](https://github.com/google/googletest). To run tests install gtest first.

TODO: Add benchmarks and additional description.
